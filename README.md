# RoyalPartsLib

This is a living repository with the purpose of being a central location for all applicable FRC COTS parts to be easily accessable for all teams.  Currently, this repository is Autodesk-oriented, but if it becomes desired, it is possible to expand to include other softwares by breaking down the main directory into seperate directories, or creating new repositories.

Please feel free to contribute by submitting Pull Requests, and ideally this is a resource that will make using CAD for FRC a much more streamlined process.
